# 🍣 sushi

***S**lick **U**ser-friendly **SH**ell **I**nterface*

## Summary 🤏
A trivial shell I built for myself to get better at Go and experiment with the awesome TUI libraries at Charm. I haven't worked on this in awhile, but might pick it back up at some point. It certainly comes with no guarantees and hasn't been built with any other users in mind.

Some cool features include:
- Fancy TUI graphics
- Autocomplete when typing commands
- Color coded pass/fail indicator for previously run commands

Some critical missing features include:
- TUI formatting can be weird sometimes :shrug:
- Lots of things probably

## How to Install 💻
Clone this repo, and from the root you can start the shell with `go run ./cmd/sushi`. If you want to get out of the shell run `exit`.

## Goals 🎯 
Primarily just a project to learn more about Go, so I'd say mission accomplished. Sharing it incase its interesting to someone else. Maybe I'll pick it back up and make it more robust one day...
